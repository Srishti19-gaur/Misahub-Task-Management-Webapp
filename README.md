This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Misahub Task Management Webapp
The Misahub Task Management Webapp is designed to help teams organize and manage tasks efficiently. Users can create, update, and track tasks, with all changes reflected in real time across multiple devices. This app integrates modern web technologies to provide a seamless user experience, focusing on simplicity, functionality, and real-time collaboration.

A standout feature of the app is its drag-and-drop functionality. Users can easily organize tasks by dragging them between different lists such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed." This intuitive feature makes it easier to prioritize and manage tasks without the need for complex interfaces or manual updates. Additionally, the app ensures that all changes are synchronized in real-time, leveraging Firebase Firestore for efficient data handling and updates across all devices.

The app is built using React.js for the frontend, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. Firebase is used for user authentication and real-time database functionality, ensuring secure and instant synchronization of tasks. The app uses MUI v5 for modern UI components and a clean, professional design. Zustand is utilized for lightweight state management, ensuring smooth and efficient handling of the app's data. The drag-and-drop feature is implemented to offer a user-friendly task organization experience, making task management more interactive and less time-consuming.

To use the app, users can sign up or log in securely via Firebase Authentication. Once logged in, they can create, update, or delete tasks, which are stored in Firebase Firestore. Changes made to tasks are instantly reflected on all connected devices, ensuring real-time collaboration. The app is designed with Firebase Security Rules, allowing secure and controlled access to user data, ensuring that only authenticated users can interact with their tasks.
